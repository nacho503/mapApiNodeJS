# Front-End of "mapApp" using "Model View Controler" with Vanila JS

## Instalations and configurations:

- npm install
- npm i parcel -D (ultima version de parsel)
- npm i sass (no se esta usando aun)

## Other configurations

- API google maps. Used with key
- Documentation: ðŸ”—https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript
- Coordenates ðŸ”—https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geolocation#maps_map_geolocation-javascript

## Comments

- parcel & sass not working yet due that it was not loading the map from Google. Once changed to regular css (style.css) the map loaded.

- working icons from: https://www.flaticon.es/ . Use the url of each.

## Pendings

- App not loading the map at first. It needs to be reloaded. (this needs to be solved)
